# Botpress NLU ‚ö°

Botpress NLU is a Botpress module that adds NLU capatibilities to your bot by connecting to the NLU provider of your choice.

**üöß I'm looking for help to support more providers**

| Provider | üö© Status |
| ------------- | :--------: |
| [LUIS](https://www.luis.ai) | ‚úÖ |
| [DialogFlow](https://dialogflow.com/) | Help needed |
| [RASA](https://github.com/RasaHQ/rasa_nlu) | Help needed |

We believe NLP/NLU is a commodity, so this package abstracts the provider by providing a standard, clean interface that allows you (and the non-technicals) to easily edit the NLU data within Botpress.

With Botpress NLU,

- You own your data
- You can seamlessly switch to another NLP provider
- _(soon)_ You can continously train your bot on misunderstood phrases
- _(soon)_ You can share and import open-source, community-curated intents & entities

## Installation

‚ö†Ô∏è **This module only works with the upcoming [Botpress X](https://github.com/botpress/botpress/tree/develop/x).**

- Install the module `yarn add botpress-nlu`
